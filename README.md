## 🌦️ Weather App

A simple weather app that lets users search for a city and get real-time weather info using the OpenWeatherMap API. It shows temperature, humidity, a weather description, and an emoji representing the weather.

## 🧩 More Coming Soon

I'll keep adding projects here — from small experiments to full-stack web apps. Each one will eventually have its own README with more details.

## 🚀 About This Repo

This is my personal project space. It's not meant to be super polished or formal — just a place to share what I’m building and learning.
