## ⚙️ How It Works

- Buttons trigger functions via `onclick` handlers.
- The display is updated dynamically using JavaScript.
- `eval()` is used for expression evaluation after replacing visual symbols (`×`, `÷`) with their JavaScript equivalents (`*`, `/`).
- Errors (like invalid input or division by zero) show `"ERROR"` in the display.
