## 🧪 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom styling with hover/active effects)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Buttons trigger functions via `onclick` handlers.
- The display is updated dynamically using JavaScript.
- `eval()` is used for expression evaluation after replacing visual symbols (`×`, `÷`) with their JavaScript equivalents (`*`, `/`).
- Errors (like invalid input or division by zero) show `"ERROR"` in the display.
